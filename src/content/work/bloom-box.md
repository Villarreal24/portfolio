## Landing Page

> Project overview

I developed a modern landing page for a client using Next.js and deployed it on Vercel. This single page application (SPA) features multiple content sections that clearly present the client's brand and offerings. We collaborated closely with the client through several meetings to gather their requirements, ideas, and expectations. The design process was carried out in Figma, ensuring a polished and user-friendly layout. Additionally, the page includes a contact form that sends visitor information directly to an email, providing an efficient way to engage with the audience. The project is optimized for speed and responsiveness, delivering a seamless user experience on any device.
