## Pokemon API Search

> A dynamic web application built with Vue 3 (Composition API) and TypeScript.

Designed to fetch and display Pokémon cards from a public Pokémon API.

Search Functionality: Users can search for any Pokémon by name, retrieving and displaying its card along with key attributes (e.g., type, abilities, stats).

Popular Pokémon List: Automatically fetches and showcases the top 20 most popular Pokémon upon initial load.

Responsive UI: A clean, interactive card-based layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

Type-Safe Development: Leverages TypeScript for robust type checking and maintainable code.

API Integration: Efficiently communicates with the Pokémon API to fetch real-time data using Fetch.

This project demonstrates modern frontend development practices, including reactive state management, modular component design, and asynchronous data handling—showcasing my ability to build scalable and user-friendly web applications.

Technical Stack: Vite, Vue 3 (Composition API), TypeScript, RESTful API Integration, TailwindCSS.
